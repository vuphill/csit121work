              resell for my online store to refund the profit back to the money i spend on, but sometime outside of claw machine
              i usally like to go to the flea market or 2nd hand store to find old toy and video games that i could make more in a 
              higher price value, my hobbies is video games because it is a good expeirence to play against online player around the
              world , but if i'm tired of online games i can play action games such as story mode or building my own world but i will 
              try my best to understand the question and work together in a group or alone for complete assignment.
